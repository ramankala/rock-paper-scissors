A Rock-Paper-Scissors game against a computer.  Built the app to further my understanding in HTML, CSS and Javascript.  Learned about HTML DOM, and deepened my knowledge on event listeners.  Click on the buttons with the rock, paper, or scissors symbols to select your choices and play the game against the computer.  The game continues until the first gamer to reach 5 points.  Click the reset button to refresh the game and start over.
